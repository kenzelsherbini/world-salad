                day before you went shopping for (stuff you bought), and were too excited to go with your best friend. When you finally arrive in  (your country), you have to 
                take a trip in (your dream car) to the hotel. Upon arriving there, the bellman greets you, but you notice there's something off with his face. You realize he's half 
                (bug your most scared of)! You tell your friend but they ignore it. The bellman acts completely normal, as if nothing is wrong The bellman acts completely normal, greeting you with (greeting). You 
                keep tellng your friend, but they insist it's jet lag. As the night goes on, and the bellman drops your suitcases in your room, you go to look out at the (view of beautiful) but notice something. The bellman is doing (put a type of flip) on the balcony
                next to you! You go to get a (defense item) to protect yourself and your friend that is sleeping and he waves his (body part of bug) at you, smiling. Terrified, you throw 
                (defense item) across the balcony but hit the wall. Your friend jolts awake and asks what happened. You point outside, shaking "The bellman—he was flipping, smiling, and... he's part bug!"
                Your friend sighs, clearly doubting you and says "(something you say to crazy people)". You nod, but deep down, you know you’ll never sleep peacefully 
                in (your dream country) again.
